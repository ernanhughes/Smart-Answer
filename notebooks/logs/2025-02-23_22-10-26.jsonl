If the shirts are spread out properly, each shirt will dry independently of the others. This means that the drying time for one shirt is the same as for multiple shirts, provided they all have equal exposure to sunlight and air.\n\n2. **Given Information**: We know that it takes 1 hour to dry 25 shirts. This implies that each shirt is drying independently, and the drying time is not affected by the number of shirts, as long as they are all exposed to the same conditions.\n\n3. **Applying the Same Conditions to 30 Shirts**: If 25 shirts take 1 hour to dry, and the drying process is independent for each shirt, then 30 shirts will also take 1 hour to dry, assuming they are all laid out in a manner that allows them to receive the same amount of sunlight and air circulation as the 25 shirts.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it will take 1 hour to dry 30 shirts under the sun, given that the conditions (sunlight and air exposure) remain consistent for all shirts.\n\nThis reasoning assumes that the drying capacity (space and exposure) is not a limiting factor. If space is limited and the shirts are overlapping or not all exposed equally, the drying time could be longer. However, based on the information provided, we assume optimal conditions.",
