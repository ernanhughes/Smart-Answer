    "_backward_through_llm": "When providing a system prompt for evaluating the correctness of a sentence, it's important to be more specific and detailed to guide the language model effectively. In this case, the prompt \"Evaluate the correctness of this sentence\" is quite general and doesn't provide any context or direction to the model on what aspects to focus on. To improve the prompt and enhance the language model's performance, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Specify the Criteria**: Instead of a generic prompt, provide specific criteria for evaluation. For example, you could ask the model to check for spelling errors, grammar mistakes, punctuation issues, clarity, coherence, or any other specific aspect of correctness.\n\n2. **Provide Context**: Give the model some context about the type of text it is evaluating. Is it a formal document, a casual conversation, a technical report, or a creative piece? This context can help the model tailor its evaluation more accurately.\n\n3. **Offer Examples**: Include examples of common errors or issues that the model should look out for. This can guide the model in understanding what to focus on when evaluating the sentence.\n\n4. **Encourage Detailed Analysis**: Encourage the model to provide detailed feedback by asking specific questions related to the sentence. For instance, you could prompt the model to identify the subject-verb agreement, check for tense consistency, or suggest improvements for clarity.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions into the system prompt, you can help the language model better understand the task at hand and provide more accurate and detailed evaluations of sentence correctness.",
