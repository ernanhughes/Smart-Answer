      "1. **Understanding the Drying Process**: Drying shirts under the sun is typically a process that depends on the exposure to sunlight and air circulation. If the shirts are spread out properly, each shirt will dry independently of the others. This means that the drying time for one shirt is the same as for multiple shirts, provided they all have equal exposure to sunlight and air.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Applying the Same Conditions to 30 Shirts**: If 25 shirts take 1 hour to dry, and the drying process is independent for each shirt, then 30 shirts will also take 1 hour to dry, assuming they are all laid out in a manner that allows them to receive the same amount of sunlight and air circulation as the 25 shirts.\n",
